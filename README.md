### How much time are you spending surfing a day? ###

An extension to give you a rough idea how much total time you are spending surfing the web on a given day, as well as broken down by domain. 

Please note that the times are approximate! Doing an exact tracking is virtually impossible, but this comes close enough to give you a good idea how much time you are spending browsing.
